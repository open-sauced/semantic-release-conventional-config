## üçï GitHub actions usage 

Since version 3 it is possible to use semantic-release without any trace of it or the open-sauced configuration anywhere in the dependency tree.

The simplest use case for a typical React application:

```yaml
name: "Release"

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: "‚òÅÔ∏è checkout repository"
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: "üöÄ release"
        id: semantic-release
        uses: docker://ghcr.io/open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config:3.0.0
        env:
          DISABLE_DOCKER: true
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.username }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: ${{ github.event.commits[0].author.email }}
```

## üì¶ NPM install and usage

```bash
npm install --save-dev @open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config
```

The shareable config can then be configured in the [**semantic-release** configuration file](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration):

```json
{
  "extends": "@open-sauced/semantic-release-conventional-config"
}
```

## üîß Configuration

See each [plugin](#plugins) documentation for required installation and configuration steps.

Set `DISABLE_DOCKER` to any value if you want to disable the docker docker plugin.

Set `private` to true in `package.json` if yof want to disable docker.

An example leveraging `node` and `docker` build artifacts can be found in [open-sauced](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml).
